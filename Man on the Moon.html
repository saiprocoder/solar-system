<h1>Man on the Moon!!</h1>
<p>It was July 20, 1969, when 600 million people over the Earth watched their television screens as the small lunar module called Eagle touched down on the Moon.

It was the first time humans had walked on any surface away from our Earth.</p>
<h2>The Mission Diary</h2>
<p>Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin and Mike Collins blast off on the Apollo 11 mission. After travelling through space for four days, the astronauts and Buzz Aldrin 

starp themselves into the Eagle and drop down onto the surface of the Moon. Mike Collins stays in the spacecraft, flying around the Moon. At 02:56 Greenwich Mean

Time, Neil Armstrong steps out of the Eagle (below) and puts his left foot down. As Neil Armstrong steps onto the Moon, he says, "That's one small step for man; one

giant leap for mankind." Buzz Aldrin joins Neil Armstrong and they spend two hours exploring, taking photogarphs, and collecting rock and dust samples to take home for 

testing. After seven hours' rest aboard the spacecraft, the astronauts begin their journey home. They land in the Pacific. The three astronauts arrive home four days 

later, in good health.</p>
<h3>A legacy for the future</h3>
<p>The astronauts put the American flag into the Moon dust. They also left behind a bag containing a golden olive leaf ----- a sign of peace ----- and a silicon disc 

carrying messages from President Richard Nixon and 73 other leaders.</p>
