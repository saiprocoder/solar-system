<h1>Kuiper Belt</h1>
<p>As you travel beyond the primary planets, there is an enormous amount of space. There are millions of icy objects there that orbit the Sun, just 

like the planets do. Beyond Neptune is an area known as the Kuiper Belt. Millions of icy bits and pieces float together around the Sun.</p>
<h2>The Oort Cloud</h2>
<p>The Oort Cloud is at the edge of our solar system. In it are the farthest objects held by our Sun's gravity. This illustartion shows the Sun with the

Oort Cloud around it.</p>
<h3>Comets</h3>
<p>Comets are balls of ice that form in the Oort Cloud. They have bright, flashing tails behind them. Comets circle the Sun, swooping toward and away from 

it.</p>
<h4>Shoemaker-Levy</h4>
<p>In 1994, a comet called Shoemaker-Levy smashed into Jupiter. It created a ball of fire the size of the Earth.</p>
