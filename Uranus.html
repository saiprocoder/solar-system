<h1>Uranus</h1>
<p>Uranus is very far away from the Sun. It is 19 times farther away from the Sun than Earth is. You can't see Uranus, or any of the planets beyond it, with the naked eye.</p>
<h2>The Blue Planet</h2>
<p>Uranus is a giant ball of gas and liquid. The surface is made of tiny crystals of a gas called methane, which makes it look blue.</p>
<h3>Moon Miranda</h3>
<p>Uranus has 27 moons. This one, Miranda, has dark areas that are gigantic cliffs as high as Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth.</p>
