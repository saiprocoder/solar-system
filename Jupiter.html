<h1>Jupiter</h1>
<p>Jupiter is the biggest planet in our Solar System. It is so big that all the other planets could fit inside it, with room to spare.</p>
<h2>The Gas Giant</h2>
<p>Jupiter is the first of the four gas planets. Bright yellow and red clouds swirl around it. Jupiter has no hard surface at all. In fact, if you flew to Jupiter, you

would find nowhere to land.</p>
<h3>Jupiter's Moon</h3>
<p>Jupiter has 63 rocky moons that orbit it. The four biggest moons are the size of small planets.</p>
<h4>The Great Red Spot</h4>
<p>The Great Red Spot is a giant, swirling storm that can be seen on surface of Jupiter. As the storm moves around, it swallows up other storms.</p>
