<h1>Mars</h1>
<p>Mars is known as the red planet, and although it looks red hot, it is actually very, very cold. It has valleys and volcanoes just like Earth does.</p>
<h2>Discovering Mars</h2>
<p>Since the late 1990's robots have landed on Mars to study it. This space rover takes photographs of Mars. Mars has canyons, which may have been once river. If there 

was water, there may also have been life. Mars has the biggest volcano ever found in space. Olympic Mons is about the size of Texas. The Pheonix landeris the latest 

spacecraft to touch down on Mars. It has found evidence of snow falling from Mars's clouds!</p>
<h3>The Red Planet</h3>
<p>Mars is a rocky planet. It is orangey-red because of rusty iron in the rocks that cover it. Huge red storms rage across the planet.</p>
