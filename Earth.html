<h1>Earth</h1>
<p>Our planet, Earth, is the only one in our solar system known to have oceans and life. That makes our planet very special indeed. Earth has only one Moon.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>Our planet is surrounded by a thick layer of gases, called the atmosphere, which is held in place by gravity. It is like a bubble protecting us from the Sun's rays.</p>
<h3>Gravity</h3>
<p>The Earth tries to pull everything toward its centre. This pull is called gravity. Gravity is the reason that things fall to the ground when you drop them, and why we

can walk without floating away.</p>
<h4>Life on Earth</h4>
<p>Earth is the only planet we know that has life on it. Plants and animals need water, the right air, and the perfect temperature to survive. Earth is the ideal place to live.</p>
