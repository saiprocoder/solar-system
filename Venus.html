<h1>Venus</h1>
<p>Venus is known as Earth's twin as it is a similar size and is made of similar rock.</p>
<h2>Cloudy Days</h2>
<p>Venus has a rocky landscape and yellow clouds. The clouds are so thick that sunlight never reaches the surface. Every day is cloudy on Venus.</p>
<h3>Burning Hot</h3>
<p>Venus is farther from the Sun than Mercury, yet it is hotter at 900°F (480°C). Venus rotates slowly, so the Sun heats it for months at a time without cooling nights.

The clouds keep the heat in, so it stays very hot.</p>
