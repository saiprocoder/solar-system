<h1>Mercury</h1>
<p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. That means it's hot ---- four times hotter than boiling water !!!</p>
<h2>Mariner 10</h2>
<p>Mariner 10 was the first space probe to fly to Mercury. It left Earth in 1973 and flew past Mercury three times.</p>
<h3>From Earth</h3>
<p>Mercury is difficult to see from Earth because it is so close to the Sun and gets lost in its light. It is visible for a few hours after sunset and before sunrise.</p>
<h4>Rocky Planets</h4>
<p>Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It is covered in huge dents, called craters. Craters are made by big rocks, called asteroids, that crash into it.</p>
