<h1>Asteroids</h1>
<p>Rocks that float around in space are called asteroids. When they hit Earth, there are known as meteorites.</p>
<h2>The Asteroid Belt</h2>
<p>Most asteroids in our solar system exist in a ring between Mars and Jupiter known as the asteroid belt. They circle our Sun, too, just like all the planets do.</p>
<h3>Dinosaur Death</h3>
<p>Many people think that the dinosaurs died out as a result of an enormous meteorite hitting the Earth about 65 million years ago.</p>
<h4>Crashing Rocks</h4>
<p>If asteroids crash into one another, rocks are flung into open space.</p>
<h5>Look out, Earth!</h5>
<p>Once in a while a loose asteroid flies into Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<h6>A Giant Dent</h6>
<p>When an asteroid hits the Earth, it makes a huge crater.</p>
